How to reverse sear steak

### Ingredients
- 1 New York Strip Steak (about 1 pound and 1 1/4" thick)
- Salt
- Oil
- Black Pepper
- Butter
- Rosemary
- Garlic

### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 200 to 225 degrees farenheit.
2. Pat dry – Start by patting dry the steak on all sides with a paper towel
3. Season generously – 2-24 hours before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper. Let the steak sit in the refridgerator before cooking to allow the seasoning to penetrate.
4. Put the steak on a rack in the oven for 45 to 60 degrees till 100-110 degrees internal (depending on your preference of doneness).
5. While the steak is heating, preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.
6. Sear steaks – add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).
7. Add butter and aromatics – melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below).
8. Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.

Enjoy!
