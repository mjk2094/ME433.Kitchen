## Description
A classical savory tofu dish from Huaiyang (Huai'an-Yangzhou) cuisine, among my favourite dishes local to my hometown.
(Sorry for the awkward translation. Hard as I tried, I could not come up with an accurate, expressive and elegant English translation of the name, so I will keep the original Chinese name for reference in compensation.)

## Ingredients
1. White dried tofu: ~200g;
2. Chicken soup: 500g - alternatively, use both monosodium glutamate or chicken essence resolution at a concentration of 0.1~0.5% and oil to emulate the flavour;
3. Salt: 1/3 teaspoonful, 1~2g (the amount as you love);
4. Edible fungi: 5g~20g, black woodear (Auricularia auriculacan) recommended, but mushroom also works;
5. Green vegetables: 50g~200g, pakchoi (Brassica chinesis), spinach, etc.
6. Ham (optional): ~10g (or any other meat you love);
7. Shrimp (optional): a little, as you like;
8. Ginger (optional): <5g;

## Instructions
1. Prepare the chicken soup, where no extra seasoning is needed. Alternatively, use monosodium glutamate of chicken essence resolve in boiled water and make sure the flavour is neither too blant or too strong.

2. Prepare the ingredients: soak the black woodear (or wash and slice the mushrooms); wash and pick the green vegetables; slice the ham (if any); peal the shrimps (if any); slice the ginger into slim threads (if any).

3. Cut the dried tofu, first into sheets, then into threads. *For advanced cooks, it is crucial the threads be as slim as 1~2mm for the best taste, but it does not have to be perfect if you are serving yourself.

(If you do not mind the smell of the tofu, skip steps 4~5)
4. Blanch the dried tofu threads in boild water for ~2 minutes. Keep getting rid of the floating scum during this process.

5. Wash the tofu threads with cold water and drain them.

(If you do not select any meat, skip step 6)
6. Transfer oil floating on the chicken soup onto a clean hot pot (or add ~2g of oil onto the pot). Stir-fry the ham (or the meat at your own choice) until it gives off aroma.

7. Fill in the chicken soup, mixed with the amount of salt you choose. Add the dried tofu threads and boil for ~10 minites at low heat with the pot covered.

8. Add edible fungi, green vegetables, ginger (if any), shrimps (if any) into the soup. Heat them up with the tofu until they are cooked.

9. You are all done! Enjoy, but do not forget to turn off the heater!
