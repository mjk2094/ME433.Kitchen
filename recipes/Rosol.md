This is a classic Polish soup my mom made every week for dinner when I was a kid. It can be used as a stock for other stews and soups.

### Ingredients
- 5 pound chicken (bone in!)
- 1 beef soup bone
- 2 large onions, root end trimmed and halved
- 5 carrots, trimmed and peeled
- 2 parsnips, trimmed and peeled
- 1 leek 
- 1 small â€“ medium celery root, peeled or 3 stalks celery
- 1/4 small savoy cabbage
- 1 whole clove
- 4 allspice berries
- 2 bay leaves
- 4 sprigs fresh flat leaf parsley
- 4 sprigs fresh dill
- 6 peppercorns
- 1 tablespoon salt (adjust amount to taste)
- thin noodles (optional)

### Instructions
1. Add chicken and beef bone to large pot.
2. Pour water until everything is covered.
3. Bring everything to a boil, and let it boil for 2 to 2.5 hours, skimming any impurities.
4. Add vegetables and spices to the same pot for an additional hour.
5. Strain everything out of the broth.
6. Bone the chicken, and pull the meat into smaller chunks.
7. Slice the carrots.
8. Add the carrots and the chicken back in.
9. Cook the noodles and add the noodles to the soup.

Enjoy!
