### Five Spice Beef Shank

This flavorful dish highlights the aromatic blend of Chinese five spice and tender beef shank. A classic home-style recipe that’s perfect for sharing with family and friends.

## Ingredients:

- Beef shank (2 pounds / 900g)
- Chinese five spice powder (1 tablespoon)
- Soy sauce (2 tablespoons)
- Shaoxing rice wine (2 tablespoons, optional)
- Kosher salt (1 teaspoon)
- Sugar (1 tablespoon)
- Fresh ginger (3 slices)
- Garlic cloves, smashed (3)
- Cooking oil (2 tablespoons)

## Instructions:

1. **Marinate the beef**: In a large bowl, combine the beef shank, Chinese five spice powder, soy sauce, Shaoxing rice wine, salt, and sugar. Mix well and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes.
2. **Sear the beef**: Heat the cooking oil in a pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the ginger slices and smashed garlic. Cook for about 1 minute, then add the marinated beef shank. Sear each side until browned.
3. **Simmer**: Once the beef is browned, add enough water to just cover the meat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Cover the pot and let it cook for 2–3 hours, or until the beef is very tender.
4. **Adjust seasoning**: Taste the broth and adjust salt or sugar if necessary. Skim off any excess fat.
5. **Serve**: Slice the beef shank thinly against the grain and serve hot, drizzled with some of the cooking liquid.
