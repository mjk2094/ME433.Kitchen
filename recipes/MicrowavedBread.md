This delicacy is rich and quite edible I assure you. 

### Ingredients
- 1 microwave 
- 1 slice of bread 

### Instructions
1. Put the single slice of bread on a plate.  
2. Put the plate (with bread slice) in the microwave.
3. Microwave on HIGH for 30 seconds, or to taste.  
4. Remove the plate with the now-microwaved bread. 

Enjoy!
