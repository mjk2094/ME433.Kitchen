## Toby's Banana Bread Recipe

This is by far my favorite recipe for banana bread, and it's the perfect way to use the bananas of the bunch that inevitably overripen.

### Ingredients
- 1/2 cup *softened* butter
- 1 cup sugar
- 2 eggs
- 4 overripe bananas
- 1 1/2 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1-2 cups chopped walnuts (to taste)
- 1-2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips (to taste)

### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350Â° F.
2. Use an electric mixer to mix butter and sugar until light and fluffy (approximately 3-4 minutes).
3. Add eggs and bananas, mix on medium speed until combined. 
4. Add flour, baking soda, salt, and vanilla extract; mix on low speed until combined.
5. Add walnuts and chocolate chips, fold by hand until just combined. 
6. Pour batter into parchment-lined loaf pan and bake for 55 minutes. Turn off oven and let rest in oven for 15-25 minutes.
