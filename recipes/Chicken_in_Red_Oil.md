# Recipe for the "Chicken in Red Oil"

This is a common cold dish in Chinese restaurants. Simply put, it's poached chicken soaked in a spicy red oil sauce.

## Ingredients

*  Chicken thighs: 4 pieces
*  Ginger: 3 slices
*  Green onions (scallions): 2 stalks
*  Star anise: 2 pieces
*  Sichuan peppercorns: a moderate amount
*  Dried red chilies: 10-15 pieces (adjust to desired spiciness)
*  Garlic: 5 cloves (minced)
*  Coriander: appropriate amount
*  Peanuts: a handful (optional)

## Seasoning

*  Soy sauce: 2 tbsp
*  White sugar: 1 tbsp
*  Rice vinegar: 1.5 tbsp
*  Sesame paste (or sesame butter): 2 tbsp
*  Chili oil: appropriate amount (adjust to taste)
*  Black vinegar: 1 tbsp
*  Sichuan pepper oil: 1 tbsp (optional)
*  Salt: to taste
*  White sesame seeds: a handful (optional)

## Cooking Step

1.  Prepare the chicken:
    Clean the chicken thighs, removing any excess fat. Place the chicken in a pot with enough water to cover it.
    Add the ginger slices, green onion stalks, star anise, and Sichuan peppercorns. Bring the water to a boil,
    skim off the foam, then lower the heat to a simmer. Cook for about 30 minutes, or until the chicken is thoroughly cooked.
2.  Cool the chicken:
    Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the pot and place it in an ice water bath for about 10 minutes to maintain its tenderness.
3.  Prepare the sauce:
    In a small bowl, combine soy sauce, rice vinegar, white sugar, sesame paste, chili oil, black vinegar, and Sichuan pepper oil (optional).
    Mix thoroughly until the sauce is smooth and well-blended.
4.  Shred the chicken:
    Remove the cooked chicken from the water bath, drain it, and remove the bones. Shred or cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and place it in a large bowl.
5.  Make the chili oil:
    Heat some oil in a pan and add the dried red chilies and Sichuan peppercorns. Stir-fry until fragrant.
    Pour the hot chili oil into the prepared sauce and mix well.
6.  Toss the chicken:
    Pour the chili sauce over the shredded chicken, stirring gently to ensure the chicken is evenly coated with the sauce.
7.  Serve:
    Transfer the seasoned chicken to a serving plate. Garnish with minced garlic, coriander, white sesame seeds, and peanuts (optional) for extra flavor and texture.

Good Luck!
