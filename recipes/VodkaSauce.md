# Spicy Vodka Sauce
### By Aileen Cleary

#### Ingredients

* ground sausage (optional)
* olive oil
* garlic cloves
* pepper flakes
* 1 can tomato paste
* vodka or preferred alcohol (optional)
* 1 can crushed tomatoes
* 1 cup heavy whipping cream
* 1 cup frozen peas

#### Instructions
1. Add olive oil to pan and heat on medium-high heat.
2. If using sausage, add to pan and cook until nearly done, with no visible pink. It will continue cooking in the sauce.
3. Mince 3 or more garlic cloves and add to pan, cooking until fragrant.
4. Add desired amount of red pepper flakes.
5. Add 1 entire can of tomato paste to pot, mixing it together with the sausage and garlic.
6. Let tomato paste cook in pan for about a minute before adding about a shot of your chosen alcohol. This will cook off, but will help deglaze the pan and unstick anything burnt to the bottom of the pan.
7. Once the alcohol has been cooked off, add in an entire can of crushed tomatoes and mix.
8. Add a cup of heavy whipping cream to pan and mix. Sauce should be homogenous and an even orange hue.
9. Add in any desired spices (e.g. salt, pepper, onion powder) to taste.
10. Add in about of cup of frozen peas if desired.
11. Put lid on pan, reduce heat to medium-low, and let cook, undisturbed, for 10-15 minutes.
12. Taste and add additional spices if needed.
13. Remove from heat and serve or let cool completely before storing in airtight container in the refrigerator. Can also be frozen. Best eaten within 3-5 days.
